Interested in building JavaScript websites that do more? Node.js and Express.js are a perfect match. Express is a fast, minimalist framework that sits on top of Node.js and allows you to build powerful single- and multi-page web applications and websites.

In this course, Ray Villalobos walks through the process of creating full-featured websites with these technologies. First, find out how to install each package and leverage Node.js features from within Express. Then learn how to build a basic application with templating engines like EJS; create more flexible, modular code with includes and conditional statements; build APIs to manage HTTP requests to add and delete content dynamically; and configure more complex routing. Along the way, Ray implements features like customer feedback forms and real-time live chat, so you can see exactly what Node.js and Express are capable of.

### Topics include:
- Handling HTTP requests with Node.js and Express
- Creating and modularizing routes
- Using templates
- Building flexible views
- Creating an API route
- Dealing with POST and DELETE requests
- Creating live chat features with Socket.IO
